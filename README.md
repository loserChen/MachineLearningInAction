# Machine Learning In Action
This repo consists of my practical code referred from 《Machine Learning In Action》.  
Besides,[this blog](https://blog.csdn.net/c406495762/column/info/16415) gave me a lot of help.  
Now the algorithms are about:
- [Adaboost](https://github.com/loserChen/MachineLearningInAction/tree/master/AdaBoost)
- [Navie Bayes](https://github.com/loserChen/MachineLearningInAction/tree/master/bayes)
- [Decision Tree](https://github.com/loserChen/MachineLearningInAction/tree/master/decisionTree)
- [K nearest neighbor](https://github.com/loserChen/MachineLearningInAction/tree/master/knn)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/loserChen/MachineLearningInAction/tree/master/lr)
Each folders have 2 editions which are based sklearn or python.  
Most of code have some Chinese comments to help you to understand algorithms well.  
Once I make some progress, I will update that in time.  
If possible, I will try my best to introduce the theory of these basic machine learning algorithms.   
But now I am a rookie for this field.  
If problem invoked, please contact me and let's diccuss about that.[my blog](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_35564813?ref=toolbar)  
Thank you for your support.  
Give a star to focus on my work in the future.
